I'm a second year PhD student at NYU Stern and an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.

My research interests generally lie in economics + computation, personalization, and data-driven decision making. I'm currently pursuing streams in algorithmic pricing collusion and personalization of generative AI content. I spent much of the 2023-2024 academic year as a research fellow at the United Nations designing methods to better detect mis- and disinformation targeting peacekeepers online. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and exploring the NYC food scene!
