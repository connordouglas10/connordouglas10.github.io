**ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a second year PhD student at NYU Stern and an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.**

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, microeconomcs/data-driven decision making, and personalization. I'm currently pursuing streams in algorithmic pricing collusion and personalization of generative AI content. I spent much of the 2023-2024 academic year as a research fellow at the United Nations designing methods to better detect mis- and disinformation targeting peacekeepers online. Prior to starting graduate school, I was an undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis, where I studied computer science + economics. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and exploring the NYC food scene!
